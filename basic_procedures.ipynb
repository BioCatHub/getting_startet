    "The usage of Git and Github is the backbone of collaboration in every software development project. Therefore, knowledge about git and github is essential. \n",
    "Of course, if you read this you probably haven't heard of git yet. Therefore, we recommend to watch the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc). Here you will find the basics you need to know about the usage of Git and the installation guide for **Windows** **Linux** and **MacOs**. Further resources can be found here:\n",
